1) A takes 5 hours to clean the entire house, and B takes 7 hours. If they work together, how long will it take for them to clean the house?

Ans :    A :  1/5            B = 1/7 

        both combined work together =   1/5  +  1/7 
                                     
        find common denominator - least common denominator 

        5 = 5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40
        7 = 7,14,21,28,35,

        least common denominator is : 35 

        A :    7/35     B  :  5/35          (7th position 35 and 5position 35)

        now, combined work together =  12/35
                                    

        t =   35/12
          =  2.9   Approx 

        Ans : 2 hours and 55minutes 

2) C can fix a broken cabinet in 4 hours, while D can fix it in 6 hours. How long will it take them to fix the cabinet if they work together?

solution =  C work rate : 1/4 
            D work rate : 1/6
            
            both combined workrate : 1/4 + 1/6

            find least common denominator : 

            4 = 4 , 8 , 12 , 
            6 = 6 , 12 

            C = 3/12      D = 2/12

            combined =  3/12 + 2/12
            Ans :    =  5/12

            T : 12/5
              : 2. 4 Hours 

              : 0.4 * 60 minutes 
              : 24 minutes 

              : 2 hours 24 minutes 

            Ans : 2.4 approx

3) G can mow a lawn in 3 hours, and H can mow the same lawn in 6 hours. How long will it take them to mow the lawn if they work together?

solution = C mow hours : 1/3  
           H mow hours : 1/6 

           find commbined work together 

           find least common denominator : 

           3 = 3,6,9,12
           6 = 6,12 

           common denominator is 6

           =  2/6  + 1/6
           =  3/6
           =  1/2

           Ans = 2/1 
               = 2 hours 


4) J can write a report in 12 hours, and K can write the same report in 15 hours. How long will it take them to write the report if they work together?                                                                                   

Ans : 6.66 Hours approx 

5) O can complete a puzzle in 4 hours, while P can complete it in 6 hours. How long will it take them to complete the puzzle if they work together?

Ans : 2.4 Hours Approx   or 2 hours and 24 minutes 

6) E can build a fence in 10 hours, while F can build it in 15 hours. How long will it take them to build the fence together? 


        =   E   build time is   1/10      F  built time is 1/15
        
        find least common denominator   =   1/10  + 1/15 

        10 = 10 , 20 ,30
        15 = 15 , 30 

        both comman denominator is 30

        E =  3/30           F =   2/30

            = 3/30  +  2/30

            = 5/30

            = 1/6

        T = 6/1
          = 6 Hours 

7) A and B can paint a room in 5 hours and 8 hours, respectively. How long will it take them to paint the room together? 
        
8) M can write a report in 5 hours, while N can write it in 7 hours. How long will it take them to write the report together?

9) I can solve a puzzle in 6 hours, while J can solve it in 9 hours. How long will it take them to solve the puzzle together?

10) E can finish a task in 7 hours, and F can finish the same task in 10 hours. How long will it take them to finish the task together?

11) S can edit a video in 9 hours, while T can edit it in 12 hours. How long will it take them to edit the video together?

12) Q can wash dishes in 10 hours, and R can wash them in 15 hours. How long will it take them to wash the dishes together?
